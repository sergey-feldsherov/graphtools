# graphtools

# TODO
* C hashmap implementation to store graph internally
* How to hint the input and output graph formats?
  * If the hint will be done with an option, then probably long options should be used for readability. Current option parser can only handle short options (aka flags).

# convert
Read a graph from a file and write it to a file (or STDOUT) in another format.
