# graphtools

# TODO

* graphstat
  * implement int in C or C++?
* convert
  * C hashmap implementation to store graph internally
  * How to hint the input and output graph formats?
    * If the hint will be done with an option, then probably long options should be used for readability. Current option parser can only handle short options (aka flags).

# graphstat

Read a graph stored as an ASCII text file (or STDIN) and print some information about it.

# convert

Read a graph from a file and write it to a file (or STDOUT) in another format.
